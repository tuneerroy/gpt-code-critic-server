# CIS 188 Final Project: GPT Code Critic

### By: Tuneer Roy (tuneerroy) & Jordan Hochman (JHawk0224)

### Description
* This project showcases a mini-server implemented using FastAPI, Kubernetes, and Docker on "tuneer.cis188.org".
* GitHub Actions is utilized to automate the build and deployment of the server whenever there is a push to the main branch.
* The server exposes an endpoint that accepts POST requests containing code to be checked and returns a SARIF file with potential errors, generated by GPT 3.5.
* Additionally, a separate GitHub action deployed on GitHub Marketplace is responsible for executing the requests to the server and displaying the SARIF files on any GitHub repository that utilizes it.

### Note
While the GitHub action is capable of running the Python script that does the code analysis directly, we decided to deploy a server using Kubernetes and Docker as part of the project requirements. However, after the project deadline, we modified the GitHub action to solely execute the Python script without making calls to our server. You can find the updated action hosted at https://github.com/tuneerroy/gpt-code-critic.
